# This is an example configuration provided by Wraith.

# This particular config is intended to demonstrate how
# to use Wraith in 'spider' mode.

# Add as many domains as necessary. Key will act as a label
domains:
  my_site:       "http://www.example.com"
  my_other_site: "http://www.test.example.com"

# Notice the absence of a `paths` property. When no paths are provided, Wraith defaults to
# spidering mode to check your entire website.

# A list of URLs to skip when spidering.
# Ruby regular expressions can be used, if prefixed with `!ruby/regexp` as defined in the YAML Cookbook​.
# See http://www.yaml.org/YAML_for_ruby.html#regexps
spider_skips:
  - /foo/bar.html           # Matches /foo/bar.html explicitly
  - !ruby/regexp /^\/baz\// # Matches any URLs that start with /baz

# the filename of the spider file to use. Default: spider.txt
spider_file: example_com_spider.txt

# the number of days to keep the site spider file
spider_days: 10

# amount of fuzz ImageMagick will use when comparing images. A higher fuzz makes the comparison less strict.
fuzz: '20%'

# the maximum acceptable level of difference (in %) between two images.
# Wraith considers it a failure if an image diff goes above this threshold.
threshold: 5

# screen widths (and optional height) to resize the browser to before taking the screenshot
screen_widths:
  - 320
  - 600x768
  - 768
  - 1024
  - 1280

# the engine to run Wraith with.
browser: "phantomjs"

# the directory that your latest screenshots will be stored in
directory: 'shots'

# choose how results are displayed in the gallery (default is `alphanumeric` if omitted)
# Different screen widths are always grouped together.
# Options:
#   alphanumeric - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by path
#   diffs_first - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
#   diffs_only - only paths with a difference are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
mode: diffs_first

# (optional, new) specify which platform to render the web page by setting user agent,
# deafult is 'desktop', can be 'mobile'
platform: desktop
