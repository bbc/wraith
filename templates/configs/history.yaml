# This is an example configuration provided by Wraith.
# Feel free to amend for your own requirements.

# This particular config is intended to demonstrate how
# to use Wraith in 'history' mode, which is best suited to
# making sure your site's appearance remains consistent over
# time.
#
# `wraith history history.yaml` # generate base screenshots
# `wraith latest history.yaml`  # take new shots and compare

# (required) The paths to capture. This particular config is using casperjs, so we can take screenshots of selectors rather than the entire page.

    selector: '.idt__news'
    before_capture: 'javascript/interact--casper.js' # (optional) JavaScript file to execute before taking the screenshot of this path.

# (optional) JavaScript file to execute before taking screenshot of every path. Default: nil
before_capture: 'javascript/wait--casper.js'

# (required) Screen widths (and optional height) to resize the browser to before taking the screenshot.
screen_widths:

# Options:
#   alphanumeric - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by path
#   diffs_first - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
#   diffs_only - only paths with a difference are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
# Note: different screen widths are always grouped together.
